# Hate Speech Machine Learning

This project seeks to answer the following questions:  
1. Is it possible to effectively classify posts on online forums as hate speech or not hate speech? 
2. Is it possible to procedurally generate interventionary responses to such instances of online hate speech?

The data this project uses comes from [A Benchmark Dataset for Learning to Intervene in Online Hate Speech](https://github.com/jing-qian/A-Benchmark-Dataset-for-Learning-to-Intervene-in-Online-Hate-Speech).
